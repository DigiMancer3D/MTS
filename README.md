# MTS
MTS (Mobile Terror Station) is a seemingly scary small project but is designed with the idea of anyone being able to obtain the parts and softs to make a network router that can handle a multitude of actions like being an Ad-hole for the network, being a Netowrk Nanny to keep your network safe from site you don't approve of, a way to stream pre-downloaded or pre-owned video files to anyone on the network, Local MultiMedia NAS/HUB. There are various other options like turning your router into your home-computer for basic useage including using a TV as a monitor!  What seems like a Terror of a task is super simple and can help make your network a bit more worry free!
